      <p>I started to get interested in programming in 2020. 
        Started by watching Harvard CS50 courses. 
        Then I started learning the Swift language (Playgrounds, Swiftbook.ru).
        But financial problems forced me to leave my studies and go to Europe to work as a truck driver.
        But because of the war in Ukraine, I was forced to evacuate my family to Switzerland. 
        And now again I have a chance to do what I love - learning programming languages and creating useful applications for people.</p>
